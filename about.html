<h1><b>About Us</b></h1>
<p><b>This organization is going to focus more on bringing awareness to homeless people in 
Decatur and possibly using the County Market building on Pershing and Woodford to 
have food drives, clothes drives, toiletries, blankets etc. We as people always talk about wanting to help the 
    homeless and doing for them but we never actually act on it. This is a way we can help. Love To Be There knows how important and essential it is to have these things in every season. This not a one time thing but is unlimited for those who have none. If we cannot provide the people with a home or even a good enough shelter, then maybe we can start somewhere else and work our way up. That's what we want to do here.</b></p>
